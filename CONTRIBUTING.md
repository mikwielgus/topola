# Contributing to Topola

*Anyone* can contribute to Topola, including you.

Contributions can be of any kind: documentation, organization,
tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests, feature
implementations, pull requests, helping to manage issues, etc.. Many of
these tasks do not require specialized programming knowledge, or any
programming at all.

## Chat

You are encouraged to join our [Matrix
chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/%23topola:tchncs.de) or [IRC
channel](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=#topola) to talk with us
before you contribute. Both chatrooms are bridged, so it does not matter
which one you join.

## Reporting issues

If you believe you have found a defect in Topola or its documentation,
please report it on our [issue
tracker](https://codeberg.org/topola/topola/issues).

Under normal operation, crashes and panics are always considered
reportable bugs.

## Writing code

We welcome code from anyone regardless of skill or experience level.
We are friendly to newcomers. We will help you with your contribution if
there are any problems.

To build Topola, follow the build instructions from our [Installation
guide](INSTALL.md).

Topola accepts contributions via pull requests. For a step-by-step guide
on how to use these, refer to Codeberg's
[documentation](https://docs.codeberg.org/collaborating/pull-requests-and-git-flow/).
